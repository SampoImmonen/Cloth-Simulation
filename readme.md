# TODO
1. better integrator
2. material system
    1. Normal maps
    2. roughness and metallic textures
    3. imgui for selecting textures
        1. UI
        2. file explorer
3. Editor Camera
4. Better UI
5. Model loading and make look nice
6. Sphere colliding with cloth
7. ImGuizmo
8. vertex selection and constrain selection and deleting springs
9. profiling and optimization
